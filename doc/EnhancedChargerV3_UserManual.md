* Maximum charge current when two batteries is charging simultaneously is 1A for each
* If supply voltage is too low, charger will drop charging current 
* Termination voltage is 4.2V
* Re-charge voltage is 4.15V
* Trickle charge voltage is <3.0V

### Requirements:
* Power supply DC 5V, 3A min

> **_WARNING!_** Do not set high charging currents with weak power supplies and cables

### Usage:
1. Connect charger to power supply (5V, 3A min) with high-current cable
2. Red leds should light up 
3. Insert batteries in battery slots
4. Adjust the charging current for each battery slot by pressing the button several times
5. When charging is complete, green leds should light up

### Indication explanation:
* In normal mode charger shows voltage ("U=x.x") and current ("A=x.x") alternately
* In current set mode the dot in the lower right corner is shown
* When both slots are active, charger current falls back to max 1A 

> **_WARNING!_** Proper operation is not guaranteed when using an inappropriate power supply, USB cable or damaged batteries!
